# Welcome to the Silk.NET Contributors' Documentation

Silk.NET 3.0 development was approved on mandate of a documentation regime that included "for-contributors"
documentation, with the goal of increasing the maintainability and ease of contribution to the library. You've landed in
the home of that documentations!

The goal of this documentation area, like `tests`, is to mirror the directory structure of `sources` to allow easy
navigation to the corresponding design notes for a given portion of the library.
